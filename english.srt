1
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:10,150
The world is filled with despair.

2
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:16,820
When you lose your way,
I want you to rely on me.

3
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,280
Shizu-sensei...

4
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:27,580
Chief Knight of the Imperial Guard,
Holy Knight Captain Hinata Sakaguchi.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,510
What is it?

6
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:32,510
The merchant from the east
has brought the new book.

7
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:33,670
Very well.

8
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:40,090
A nation of monsters,

9
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:42,460
the Jura Tempest Federation...

10
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:45,900
Jura Tempest Federation

11
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,560
The Great Forest of Jura
stretches across the center

12
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,220
of the eastern part of the continent.

13
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:53,100
With Goblins, Ogres,
Orcs, Lizardmen, and more,

14
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,500
a wide variety of monster species
called this forest home

15
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,530
when the new nation
was suddenly built in it.

16
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:02,910
A nation of monsters: Tempest.

17
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:06,960
The city is clean and well-maintained
for comfortable living.

18
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:13,300
Its residents are educated in reading,
writing, arithmetic, and other subjects,

19
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:19,260
and they produce weapons, armor, silk,
and other products with well-trained skills.

20
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:21,260
Armed Nation of
Dwargon

21
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:24,480
The Armed Nation of Dwargon,
a nation of Dwarves

22
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,600
ruled by Gazel Dwargo,

23
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:29,980
Kingdom of
Blumund

24
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,980
and the Kingdom of Blumund,
a nation of humans,

25
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:33,150
have established friendships with it.

26
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:38,730
It also participates in trading
and enjoys a stable economy.

27
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,800
Its influence grows by the day.

28
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:48,140
The leader of this nation of monsters,
the Jura Tempest Federation...

29
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:54,910
is named Rimuru Tempest.

30
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:58,990
Rimuru...

31
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:30,980
That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime

32
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:33,520
I'm Rimuru Tempest.

33
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:35,230
Digression: Hinata Sakaguchi

34
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,150
As you can see, I'm a slime.

35
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:39,830
But I used to be a human.

36
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,370
Sure is peaceful...

37
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:49,080
This is the former me.

38
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,060
Mikami Satoru, age 37,

39
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,020
and a virg—

40
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:58,840
I was a pretty good-looking guy,
if I do say so myself.

41
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,920
Yeah, I think I was. Don't you?

42
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,340
You do, right?

43
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:09,990
I was a fairly capable employee
at a major general contracting firm.

44
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:11,500
But...

45
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:19,820
Tamura!

46
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,060
S-Senpai!

47
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,720
I was stabbed in a random attack...

48
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,600
and died.

49
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,970
And then...

50
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:57,740
for some reason, I was reincarnated
in another world as a slime.

51
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,360
And that's what happened.

52
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:09,070
I am the Storm Dragon, Veldora.

53
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:10,660
Storm Dragon?

54
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:15,020
I am one of only four True Dragons
that exist in this world.

55
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:25,930
Veldora was the first friend
I made in this world.

56
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,210
Please grant us your protection!

57
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:35,260
If you do, we will swear our loyalty to you!

58
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,440
We will swear!

59
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:41,130
In lieu of the Storm Dragon Veldora,

60
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:43,940
I, Rimuru Tempest, will grant your wish!

61
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:48,360
In some bizarre twist,
I became the protector of the Goblins...

62
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,370
Our pack yields to you.

63
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:55,820
And then I became
the head of a Direwolf pack.

64
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,300
Please accept our allegiance.

65
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:02,710
We will continue to serve you.

66
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:05,260
You're sure?

67
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:07,720
I have no objections.

68
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:11,550
We are truly fortunate to have met you.

69
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,070
I'm your secretary and
bodyguard, Great Rimuru!

70
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:19,190
I'll never leave your side!

71
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:22,040
Not until the ends of our lives.

72
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,440
O-Okay...

73
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:27,080
And before I knew what was happening,

74
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:32,830
I was revered as the head of the Ogres,
Orcs, and all kinds of other races.

75
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:37,430
Then our nation shall be called
the Jura Tempest Federation,

76
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:40,250
and this town shall be called Rimuru!

77
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,500
Huh?!

78
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,620
Capital City Rimuru!

79
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,560
Hang on, that's kinda embarrassi—

80
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,080
Capital City Rimuru!

81
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,730
No other name would do!

82
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:52,050
I agree. It's a perfect name for our town.

83
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:55,200
Since I had become this nation's leader,

84
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,110
I made up my mind to protect all my allies

85
00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:03,150
and make Tempest a safe, prosperous,
comfortable city to live in.

86
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:05,510
And then, somehow...

87
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:10,410
I ended up becoming a school teacher.

88
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:14,280
This is the Kingdom of Ingrassia.

89
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:14,280
Kingdom of Ingrassia

90
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:18,200
It's the leading cultural center
of the western part of the continent,

91
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,920
as well as a large, vibrant nation.

92
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,990
There, a mutual aid organization
for adventurers, the Free Union,

93
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:32,870
established Freedom Academy to
nurture and teach its members.

94
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,660
And that's where...

95
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:38,470
I was appointed to teach
a class of problematic kids.

96
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:43,810
The five of them were the regret
that Shizu-san had left behind.

97
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:50,150
Shizu-san had come to this world
from Japan, just like me.

98
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:01,710
I reincarnated here after dying in Japan,

99
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:05,460
but Shizu-san was a Summon,
meaning she had been summoned here...

100
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:20,460
by the Demon Lord Leon Cromwell.

101
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,840
I thought she was useless, but she
may have an affinity for fire.

102
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:34,940
Ifrit, I offer her body to you.

103
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,500
Use it well.

104
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:53,780
A Summon, as the name suggests,

105
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:56,720
is someone who was summoned into this world.

106
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,350
A Summon?

107
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:00,720
Is that different from Otherworlders?

108
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,190
It takes more than 30 mages to perform
a ritual that lasts several days

109
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:06,980
to bring one here from another world.

110
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:10,640
They're also expected to serve
as powerful weapons.

111
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,750
Weapons?

112
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,690
Yes, for the Summoner.

113
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:16,550
Magic is used to carve a curse
into the Summon's soul

114
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:19,240
to ensure that the Summon
can't defy the Summoner.

115
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,240
What the heck?! That's just cruel!

116
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,050
Cruel, eh?

117
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:26,820
I don't know what your world was like,

118
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:31,250
but survival of the fittest is the
prevailing truth in this world.

119
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,700
I see...

120
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:38,360
Shizu-san remained in service
to the Demon Lord Leon.

121
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:44,430
Whether that's because of a curse
or because of the fire spirit Ifrit

122
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:47,240
was unclear, even to Shizu-san herself.

123
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,720
Several years passed.

124
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,940
After an intense battle,

125
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:57,820
the Demon Lord abandoned his castle
and vanished somewhere,

126
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,820
leaving Shizu-san behind.

127
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,710
I can't beat her...

128
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:14,980
Shizu-san was then taken in by the Hero.

129
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,470
She traveled with the Hero for years...

130
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:20,600
and even after they parted ways,

131
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:25,930
she traveled the world as an adventurer
to save people who were suffering.

132
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:30,100
Eventually, she became known as a Champion.

133
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:34,980
But as she grew older, her magic weakened,

134
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:38,160
and she began to lose control over Ifrit.

135
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:42,630
She didn't want to risk
hurting anyone she cared about,

136
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:46,920
so she retired from adventuring
and became a teacher at Freedom Academy.

137
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:49,500
Among her students was Yuuki Kagurazaka,

138
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:54,420
who became the Grandmaster
of the adventurers' guild.

139
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:58,420
I heard that there was another
who left Shizu-san's side,

140
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:01,580
but her last batch of students...

141
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:04,300
Yes, Kenya Misaki,

142
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,360
Ryota Sekiguchi,

143
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,970
Gale Gibson,

144
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:09,590
Alice Rondo,

145
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:11,980
and Chloe Aubert...

146
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:17,020
were all Summons from
the world I had come from.

147
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,240
What're we gonna do today, Sensei?

148
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,870
That's a good question.
What should we do today?

149
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:25,750
But then,

150
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,960
Shizu-san sensed that she
didn't have long left to live...

151
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,380
and she set out on her final journey.

152
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:38,880
So, do you like our town?

153
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,390
Yes, very much.

154
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:49,270
You're welcome to stay
as long as you'd like, Shizu-san.

155
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:53,150
Thank you... but I have to go.

156
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:54,420
You do?

157
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:58,530
If I stay here, I might
bring trouble for you.

158
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:04,570
The goal of my journey is...

159
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:06,060
Goal?

160
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,560
...to find the man who summoned me.

161
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:14,040
What will you do when you find him?

162
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:20,940
She wanted to see the Demon
Lord Leon Cromwell again.

163
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:25,100
But she couldn't fulfill that goal.

164
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:32,900
Take this! Icicle Shotgun!

165
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:39,420
She could no longer restrain Ifrit,

166
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,770
and then...

167
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:55,840
Hey, Slime-san, what's your name?

168
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,430
Huh? I told you, I'm Rimuru.

169
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:01,590
No, I mean your real name.

170
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:02,910
Oh...

171
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:07,090
It's Satoru. Mikami Satoru.

172
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:12,050
I'm Shizue. Izawa Shizue.

173
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:19,450
Shizue-san, you should sleep now.

174
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:24,390
Satoru-san, I'd like to ask a favor.

175
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:25,740
May I?

176
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,750
Of course. Ask me anything.

177
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,530
Please...

178
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:35,830
eat me.

179
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:44,910
Just like you ate the curse
that had been cast on me.

180
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:47,960
That made me so happy.

181
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,860
I dislike this world...

182
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:58,770
Still, I can't abhor it.

183
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:02,850
Just like that man...

184
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:06,100
So... That's why...

185
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:10,890
I don't want to be absorbed by this world.

186
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:15,370
This is... my last request.

187
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:24,400
Would you... let me rest inside you?

188
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,140
Okay.

189
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:43,200
I swear to you on the name of
Mikami Satoru... no, Rimuru Tempest,

190
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:47,320
that I will make certain the Demon Lord
Leon Cromwell hears your wishes!

191
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,710
Thank... you...

192
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:04,540
Shizu-san, my destined one...

193
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:08,090
Rest in peace within me.

194
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:11,340
Use unique skill "Predator"?

195
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:12,300
Use unique skill "Predator"?

196
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:13,940
Yes.

197
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:19,600
So that she can dream happy dreams forever
and never have to wake from them.

198
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:35,110
You intend to interfere with my plans,

199
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:39,830
leader of the Great Forest
of Jura, Rimuru Tempest?

200
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,190
Orcs.

201
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:52,430
I had the idea to use those starved pigs
to strengthen my forces, but...

202
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:16,130
I've acknowledged you as an enemy.

203
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:19,370
Now I'll take you on for real.

204
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:22,080
Laughable!

205
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:25,200
Does that mean you weren't
serious before now?

206
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,130
There is nothing more you can do!

207
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:32,630
Just accept that I'm going to eat you!

208
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:37,330
Before you can eat me, I'm going to eat you.

209
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:41,420
I'm a slime.

210
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:43,410
Wha—

211
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:47,650
Wh-Why, you...

212
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:51,580
You're not the only one who can eat things!

213
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,660
Will you eat me first...

214
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:01,880
or will I eat you first?

215
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,420
The one who completely
consumes the other wins!

216
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:29,500
I never even imagined
that you would interfere.

217
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:39,600
Even though I sent out
the resurrected Charybdis after that,

218
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:44,340
the Demon Lord Milim joined their side...

219
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:51,220
I've already seen that trick.

220
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:53,920
Now, I'll show you one of mine.

221
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:01,110
This is...

222
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:04,430
what you call "restraint"!

223
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:09,060
Drago Buster!

224
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:21,160
Well, no matter.

225
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:25,540
I will make use of Milim soon enough.

226
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:30,140
As for that slime... Rimuru,
as I believe he is called...

227
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:32,470
I will see that he disappears

228
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:36,300
along with his beloved nation of Tempest
and everyone dear to him.

229
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:41,560
He has truly started
to become a nuisance of late.

230
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:47,890
Since he chose to interfere
with the Demon Lord Clayman,

231
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:50,960
I must assume he is prepared
for the consequences.

232
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,860
Shizu-san's lingering regret

233
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:04,290
was the five kids who
were summoned into this world.

234
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:09,310
When a summoning is performed,
there are times when a child is summoned.

235
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:12,480
And when an amount of energy too vast

236
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,790
for that child's growing body is taken in...

237
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:21,950
Eventually, that body will be incinerated
by all that energy with nowhere to go.

238
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:25,170
No one has found a way to
prevent their destruction.

239
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:29,690
Nearly all children under the age
of ten who have been summoned

240
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:31,980
have died within five years.

241
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,580
Please!

242
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:38,110
If it's at all possible,
please save those children!

243
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:41,980
I'll just do whatever I can.

244
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:45,740
It's what I've always done,
and what I'll continue to do.

245
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,770
That was when I thought...

246
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:53,030
Shizu-san was also summoned as a child,

247
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:54,480
but she lived.

248
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,480
Was it because housing Ifrit within her body

249
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,800
enabled her to control
the energy she had inside her?

250
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:05,680
So I decided to get spirits
to dwell in the kids' bodies,

251
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,810
and we headed to the Dwelling of Spirits.

252
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:11,000
Our goal was to capture superior spirits.

253
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:16,920
In the Dwelling of Spirits, we got
the Queen of Spirits, Ramiris, to help us.

254
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,940
Right!

255
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:24,260
Kenya, Ryota, Gale, Alice, Chloe...

256
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,250
Let's do this!

257
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,380
Yeah!

258
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,850
Shizu-san, wherever you are,
are you watching?

259
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:34,730
I'll make sure your wish is realized.

260
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,590
And then...

261
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:45,090
I helped each of the kids house a spirit,

262
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:48,280
successfully stabilizing
the magicules in their bodies.

263
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:54,540
Although I'm not sure what the one
that took up residence in Chloe was...

264
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:57,160
But it worked out, so it's not a problem!

265
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,580
Yep! All's well that ends well!

266
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:12,290
I did it, Shizu-san.

267
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:14,720
They'll be okay now.

268
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:19,930
With that, Shizu-san's
lingering regret was resolved.

269
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:22,010
And they all lived happily ever after!

270
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:27,420
At least, that's what I thought.

271
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:31,760
But I had no idea that
an unimaginable disaster

272
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:37,730
was about to strike Tempest,
my allies, and me personally...

273
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:42,730
and that disaster would be brought to us

274
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:46,430
by Shizu-san's former student,
Hinata Sakaguchi.

275
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,520
Rimuru Tempest... and Shizu-sensei?

276
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:04,560
I see. So you...

277
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:08,420
killed Shizu-sensei.
